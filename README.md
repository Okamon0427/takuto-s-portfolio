# Takuto's portfolio 
This is my portfolio website which shows my biography, skills, and projects I have ever involved in.

## Description
HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery are used to develop this website, which has responsible design for smartphone by using media queries. In addition, basic animations makes this website modern.

## Note
In contact page of this website, mail-form cannot be used as I have not prepared the system yet. If you would like to contact me, please use the links (Github, Linkedin, and Instagram) under the mail-form. Also, my technical skills shown in the skills page are incorrect because I'm just studying back-end language or tools such as Ruby on Rails and Docker. However, I'm going to obtain these skills before I will graduate from a college in Toronto.
